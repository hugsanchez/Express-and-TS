CONS OF TYPE DEFINITION FILES
-Type definition files alone can't express what is going on in the JS world accurately (example:middleware)
-Type definition files provided to us aren't always accurate

-EXACERBATED BY THE TYPE DEFINITION FILE
--inputs to a server (or any program with external inputs) are not guaranteed to exist or be of the correct type

PROS OF TYPE DEFINITION FILES
-Addressing these type issues with TypeScript can force us to write better code

Editing the type definition file never good idea
-dependency to project edits get deleted
